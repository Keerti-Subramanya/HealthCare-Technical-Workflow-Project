41010995,Is Body Mass Index a Prognostic Factor in Metastatic HER2-Positive Breast Cancer? A Real-World Multicenter Study.,"['Zeliha Birsin', 'Hülya Odabaşı Bükün', 'İsmail Nazlı', 'Onur Alkan', 'Murat Günaltılı', 'Emir Çerme', 'Vali Aliyev', 'Selin Cebeci', 'Seda Jeral', 'Hamza Abbasov', 'Türkkan Evrensel', 'Çiğdem Papila', 'Nebi Serkan Demirci', 'Özkan Alan']","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2025,10.3390/medicina61091604,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41010995/,"Background and Objectives: The prognostic significance of body mass index (BMI) in metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) remains unclear, with previous studies yielding conflicting results. This multicenter real-world study aimed to investigate the prognostic role of BMI in this patient population. Materials and Methods : A total of 169 female patients with metastatic HER2-positive BC who received trastuzumab-based treatment between 2010 and 2024 were included. Patients were categorized by BMI (<30 kg/m 2 vs. ≥30 kg/m 2 ). The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed overall and in subgroups stratified by hormone receptor (HR) status. Results : In the overall cohort, a BMI ≥ 30 was not significantly associated with OS or PFS. However, in the HR-positive/HER2-positive subgroup, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 was linked to significantly shorter OS ( p = 0.024) and PFS ( p = 0.047) by Kaplan-Meier analysis. However, these associations did not remain statistically significant in multivariate analyses. No significant BMI-related differences were observed in the HR-negative subgroup. Other independent negative prognostic factors included recurrent disease, the presence of brain metastases, and a high Ki-67 index. Conclusions : BMI was not identified as an independent prognostic factor in the overall population. However, among HR-positive/HER2-positive patients, obesity was associated with poorer survival in univariate analysis, but this was not confirmed in multivariate analysis. These findings underscore the need for prospective studies to clarify the prognostic role of adiposity, considering biological subtypes."

This study aimed to verify the impact of body composition changes on treatment-related toxicities, dose modifications, and clinical outcomes in patients receiving T-DXd. A retrospective analysis on 35 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer was conducted, analyzing body composition parameters such as subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), skeletal muscle area (SMA), and skeletal muscle index (SMI)-assessed using CT scans at baseline (T0) and after a median follow-up of 4 months (T1)-and calculating ΔT0-T1% of each parameter. Significant reductions over time were observed in SAT (mean ΔSAT% = -5.7%, p = 0.023) and SMA (mean ΔSMA% = -4.9%, p = 0.001). Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were common, with 31% of patients experiencing severe (Grade 3-4) toxicities. Patients with higher ΔSAT% (above the median value) experienced Grade 3-4 toxicities more frequently compared to those with lower ΔSAT% (below the median) ( p < 0.05). Among patients without toxicities, a significant decrease in SAT was observed between T0 and T1 ( p = 0.003), while no significant change was detected in patients with Grade 3-4 toxicities ( p = 0.929). Greater reductions in SMA were associated with increased rates of treatment discontinuation (75% vs. 29%, p = 0.009). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed that greater reductions in SMA significantly increased the risk of mortality (HR 5.1, 95% CI: 1.05-24.79; p = 0.025) and showed a trend toward higher risk of disease progression (HR 2.58, 95% CI: 0.89-7.49; p = 0.063). Changes in body composition, particularly reductions in SMA, were associated with increased treatment discontinuation and mortality in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer receiving T-DXd. Increase in SAT was associated with higher rates of severe toxicities, highlighting its potential role in predicting treatment-related complications, and the clinical relevance of nutritional changes on outcomes in this setting."

We now describe the binding properties and preclinical activity of mAb104-ADCs developed through the conjugation of mAb104 via linkers to the anti-microtubule drug maytansoinoid ematansine (DM1-SMCC; DM1), topoisomerase I inhibitor, exatecan derivative (MC-GGFG-DX8951; DX8951) or microtubule disruptor monomethyl auristatin E (MC-vc-PAB-MMAE; MMAE). Mab104-ADCs demonstrate dose-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro. The safety of single-dose mAb104-DX8951 was demonstrated in vivo at doses up to 10 mg/kg. MAb104-ADCs also demonstrated potent and prolonged anti-tumour activity in a range of tumour types with variable HER2 expression. Mab104-DX8951 showed significant responses in trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer, low HER2-expressing cancers, as well as HER2-overexpressing cancers. These findings indicate the potential for tumour-specific targeting of HER2-expressing tumours with mAb104-ADCs."

A 45-year-old woman with HER2-low MBC and normal body composition (BMI 22.9 kg/m 2 , visceral adipose area [VAT] 69.1 cm 2 ) developed T-DXd myopathy. She experienced dysphagia, Grade III myalgia, and creatine kinase (CK) peak of 1755 U/L, with MRI confirming lumbar subcutaneous edema and paraspinal muscle swelling. T-DXd was discontinued. Supportive therapy included hydration, urine alkalization by sodium bicarbonate, glutathione, and magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate. By Day 8, CK decreased to 539 U/L with myalgia improvement. After 13 days off therapy, CK rebounded to 1735 U/L with Grade III myalgia, which resolved upon reinitiating support. This case report presents the first documented instance of severe T-DXd-related myopathy in a patient with normal body composition. The observed case outcomes suggest that the combination of glutathione and magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate could potentially reduce CK levels and alleviate T-DXd-associated muscle pain. However, the observed clinical efficacy is based on an individual case. Extrapolation of these clinical outcomes requires large-scale randomized controlled trials with rigorous covariate adjustment."
40998389,Advances in Proximity-Assisted Bioconjugation.,"['Mary Canzano', 'Gonçalo J L Bernardes']",Accounts of chemical research,2025,10.1021/acs.accounts.5c00368,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40998389/,"ConspectusProximity-induced chemistry (PIC) refers to the transient reactivity between two or more molecules upon physical closeness which are otherwise unreactive. Harnessed by nature to control fundamental biological processes such as transcription and signal transduction, PIC increases the probability of correctly oriented, effective collisions, facilitating fundamental cellular processes. Within the field of chemical biology, PIC has been employed for several clinically relevant purposes, including the degradation of aberrant biomolecules and construction of protein therapeutics. This Account focuses on the application of PIC strategies for the development of site-specific bioconjugation techniques, termed proximity-assisted bioconjugation (PAB). Site-specific bioconjugation refers to the precise modification of biomolecules to generate homogeneous products. Such techniques are vital for the development of protein therapeutics including antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), the investigation of the biological mechanisms of post-translational modifications (PTMs), and the visualization of biomolecular interactions in vitro and in vivo . While numerous strategies have been developed, many suffer from poor yields, limited product stability, demanding experimental procedures, and/or a lack of regioselectivity. Thus, PIC principles have been implemented to address these limitations, leading to the development of PAB strategies which achieve precise, regioselective modification of biomolecules. In this Account, we describe the development of PAB techniques within our group at the University of Cambridge and Instituto de Medicina Molecular (iMM) over the past five years. Our journey with PAB began serendipitously while investigating maleic acid derivatives for cysteine bioconjugation. Here, we discovered the secondary participation of proximal lysines on Trastuzumab-V205C and Gemtuzumab-V205C, conjugatable THIOMAB antibodies commonly used in ADCs, leading to the formation of distinct bioconjugate products relative to IgGs without such lysines. Further investigation into the proximal lysine (K207) of Trastuzumab-V205C revealed that residue 207 could be harnessed directly or mutated to precisely tune the stability of ADCs due to proximity interactions between K207 and covalent modifications of C205. Considering that two Trastuzumab drug conjugates are approved for clinical use, these findings have contributed to the evolving understanding of the chemical landscape of this antibody and help inform future ADC design and development. Further, we describe efforts from our group to develop two distinct PAB approaches: regioselective lysine acetylation of histone H3 and phage display-compatible peptide cyclization. These strategies combine induced-proximity with traditional bioconjugation techniques to enable regioselective modification of biomolecules which are historically difficult to selectively modify. These methods are readily adaptable to related systems and serve as representative examples of how to successfully develop PAB strategies for desired applications. In short, this Account highlights our group's contributions to and insights on PAB methodologies wherein we illustrate how PIC can be thoughtfully applied to bioconjugation techniques for various aims including regioselective bioconjugation and enhanced bioconjugate stability. We expect that PAB approaches will continue to diversify bioconjugation applications and greatly expand the toolkit of chemical biologists."

This prospective, single-center study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of multimodal MR functional imaging in grading malignant breast tumors and monitoring trastuzumab response. Eighty HER2-positive patients confirmed by IHC/FISH were enrolled, including 41 low-grade and 39 high-grade tumors (Nottingham grading system). Patients underwent comprehensive MR imaging, including diffusion tensor imaging, MR spectroscopy and perfusion imaging at baseline and during therapy. Tumor morphological features (size, necrosis, hemorrhage, edema, boundary clarity) and functional MR parameters (FA, tCho, MTT, TTP) were analyzed for correlation with pathological grade and treatment response. High-grade tumors showed larger size, more necrosis, hemorrhage and edema (P<0.05). Functional MR parameters, particularly tCho, MTT and TTP, correlated positively with tumor grade (P<0.05). ROC analysis demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 89.2%, specificity 79.5%, AUC=0.887). Typical MR imaging patterns also reflected trastuzumab responsiveness, indicating potential for noninvasive monitoring of therapy. Multimodal MR functional imaging thus provides a sensitive and specific tool for tumor grading and evaluation of targeted therapeutic response."

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) share comparable proteomic phenotypes to those of the primary tumor and represent a less invasive method for evaluating HER2 expression. Nevertheless, methods for detecting HER2 expression on CTCs still require further investigation. A flow cytometry method for detecting HER2-overexpressed CTCs was established by spiking NCI-N87 cells into blood from cancer-naive donors. The method was then applied to blood samples from 14 gastric cancer (GC) patients (4 with HER2-overexpressed tumors and 10 with HER2-wild type tumors) and 10 cancer-naive participants (CNPs), with all data analyzed using one-way ANOVA. The gating strategy was defined as CD45 - CK-7/8 + CK-14/15/16/19 + EpCAM + HER2 + , with a cut-off value of 5 cells/mL. Using this in-house method, we detected HER2-overexpressed CTCs in 4 of 4 GC patients with HER2-overexpressed tumors (ranging from 8 to 29 cells/mL), while 10 of 10 CNPs had undetectable HER2-overexpressed CTCs. Among GC participants with HER2-wild type tumors, 7 of 10 GC participants had undetectable HER2-overexpressed CTCs, whereas 3 of 10 had detectable HER2-overexpressed CTCs. Furthermore, one participant with HER2-overexpressed CTCs detected by our in-house method received HER2-based targeted therapy and experienced an objective response and was free from disease progression to the date of article writing. This study introduces a noninvasive method for monitoring HER2 expression in GC, offering new insights into providing personalized treatment strategies."

However, DI-SCLE is associated with medication use and generally resolves or greatly improves following discontinuation. Chemotherapeutic agents are common triggers of DI-SCLE. We report a patient with breast cancer who experienced multiple episodes of DI-SCLE associated with the use of different chemotherapeutic agents for treatment-resistant cancer. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this case highlights the first reported association of DI-SCLE with trastuzumab deruxtecan. Additionally, this case is unique owing to a component of radiation recall dermatitis, as the rash was prominent in areas that had prior ionizing radiation. A prior history of DI-SCLE in oncology patients who continue to undergo treatment should prompt clinicians to consider DI-SCLE when faced with a new photodistributed, erythematous, annular, and scaly eruption. Early initiation of immunomodulating agents like hydroxychloroquine in patients with a history of moderate to severe DI-SCLE to chemotherapy who continue to undergo anti-cancer treatment may provide benefit and warrants further investigation."

Endocrine therapy (ET) has been foundational in HR+ BC treatment, significantly reducing recurrence and mortality rates, yet resistance to ET remains a critical challenge, particularly in the metastatic setting. Recent treatment advancements-especially CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) in first-line therapy, have reshaped management of HR+ HER2- mBC. Additionally, novel agents like selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), have proven to be effective against ER-resistance inducing mutations, such as ESR1, while poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) showed targeted benefit in BRCA-mutated tumors. In breast cancer expressing AKT/PIK3CA pathway alterations, drugs like alpelisib, capivasertib, and inavolisib have recently been approved, demonstrating improved PFS in this specific patient population. Recent developments of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have also extended therapeutic options to previously labeled HER2-negative tumors, with drugs like trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) demonstrating efficacy in newly emerged HER2-low and HER2-ultralow pathologic subgroups, extending median overall survival to almost 2 years. Most of these drugs have paved the way for personalized medicine and opened questions around optimal sequencing of ET and application of combination therapies, which continue to be investigated through clinical trials. This review seeks to highlight current and emerging treatment strategies addressing ET resistance to improve survival outcomes for HR+ mBC patients, emphasizing the need for personalized approaches."

Specifically, we assessed the impact of dual blockade (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), trastuzumab alone, or no HER2-targeted therapy on rates of residual disease, pathological complete response (pCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, including 299 patients with non-metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and either dual HER2 blockade, trastuzumab alone, or no HER2-targeted therapy due to financial constraints. Patient demographics, clinical features, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results The median age at diagnosis was 45.7 years (standard deviation±8.9). A majority of patients were premenopausal (n=222; 74.2%), and the majority presented with a palpable lump (n=275; 91.9%). Tumors were mainly located in the left (n=149; 49.8%) or right breast (n=147; 49.2%), with bilateral involvement in 3 (1.0%) cases. Invasive ductal carcinoma was the predominant histology (n=275; 91.9%), with estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positivity observed in 185 (61.9%) and 179 (59.9%) patients, respectively. Grade III tumors were observed in 156 (52.2%) cases, and most tumors were T2 stage (n=236; 78.9%) with axillary nodal involvement in 232 (77.6%). Patients receiving dual HER2 blockade achieved a pCR in 45 (54.9%) of 82 cases, compared to 51 (45.9%) of 111 with trastuzumab alone, and 39 (36.8%) of 106 with no HER2 therapy (p=0.046). The docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab (TCHP) regimen had the highest pCR rate in 19 (65.5%) of 29 patients (p<0.001). Grade III tumors were associated with higher pCR than Grade II (n=96; 56.5% vs. n=39; 30.2%; p<0.001). At 60 months, PFS was 236 (79.0%) overall, highest in the dual blockade group (n=73; 89.0%), followed by trastuzumab (n=96; 86.5%) and no HER2 therapy (n=69; 65.1%). OS at 60 months was 271 (90.6%), highest in the dual blockade group (n=78; 95.1%), then trastuzumab (n=102; 91.9%) and no HER2 therapy (n=79; 74.5%). Achieving pCR was associated with improved PFS and OS. Differences in both outcomes across groups were statistically significant (p<0.001). Conclusion Dual HER2 blockade significantly improved pCR, PFS, and OS in non-metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. These findings support the inclusion of HER2-targeted agents in standard neoadjuvant treatment, even in resource-limited settings. Addressing barriers to access remains essential to improving global outcomes in breast cancer care."

These cancers exhibit distinct molecular features, often leading to aggressive growth and higher recurrence rates. HR+/HER2+ breast cancer cells can utilize estrogen and HER2-driven signaling pathways to promote proliferation, survival, and metastatic potential, presenting unique challenges and opportunities for treatment. The current therapeutic strategies focus on a combination of endocrine therapies, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (e.g., tamoxifen) or aromatase inhibitors, with HER2-targeted therapies like trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or tyrosine kinase inhibitors, to concurrently inhibit both hormone and HER2-driven pathways. Despite initial treatment efficacy, resistance often develops through various mechanisms, including mutations in the PIK3CA gene, cross-talk between ER and HER2 signaling, and activation of alternative growth pathways. Ongoing research aims to improve patient outcomes by exploring novel combination therapies, including CDK4/6 inhibitors and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors, and by targeting resistance pathways.

40982170,Efficacy and Safety of Dual Therapy with HER2-inhibitors (Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab) in Gastric or Gastroesophageal Tumors: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"['Geraldo Lucas Lopes Costa', 'João Victor Ramos da Cruz', 'José Roberto Alves', 'Saint Clair Vieira de Oliveira', 'Leticia Vieira Dos Santos Ribeiro', 'Arthur Henrique Gohr', 'Daniella Serafin Couto Vieira']",Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,2025,10.1007/s12029-025-01310-z,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40982170/,"The benefit of adding dual HER2 inhibition with Pertuzumab (P) and Trastuzumab (T) to chemotherapy (cT) in HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer is not yet fully elucidated. A systematic search of PubMed, Cochrane Central, Embase, Web of Science, SciELO, and LILACS identified clinical trials investigating adjuvant or neoadjuvant regimens combining (P), (T) and (cT). Hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) for binary endpoints were calculated, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Four clinical trials comprising a total of 1,225 patients were included. Dual HER2 blockade plus (cT) showed a significant benefit in survival analysis (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.69-0.86), especially in terms of overall survival (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61-0.99) and progression-free survival (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62-0.85). Pathological response rates were higher compared with (cT) alone (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.98-2.66). Treatment was associated with an increased overall adverse event rate (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.32-1.66), particularly any-grade diarrhea, hypokalemia, fatigue, and pulmonary infection. Serious adverse events, including deaths and complications, were not significantly different (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.51-1.49). This systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials demonstrates that adding (P), (T) and (cT) improves survival and pathological response in HER2-positive gastric and GEJ tumors, with a manageable safety profile."

Contemporary autopsy series reports splenic involvement in <1% of breast cancer-related deaths, and fewer than 15 well-documented ISM cases have been published. We report a 71-year-old woman presenting with a right-breast mass, regional lymphadenopathy, and a solitary splenic lesion detected on staging computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography-CT. Biopsy confirmed hormone receptor-negative, HER2-positive invasive ductal carcinoma. Six cycles of docetaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab led to a 59% reduction in the primary tumour and complete radiological resolution of the splenic lesion. The patient remains progression-free 22 months after initiating therapy, maintained on trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Although extremely rare, ISM can present as the initial manifestation of de novo metastatic breast cancer. Awareness of this possibility may facilitate early systemic therapy and obviate the need for diagnostic splenectomy."
40976668,Canadian real-world hybrid longitudinal cohort study of treatment discontinuations and modifications for patients with HER2+ and HER2-low metastatic breast cancer on trastuzumab deruxtecan enrolled in a patient support programme: the HER-TEMPO study protocol.,"['Christine Brezden-Masley', 'Rana Qadeer', 'Zhor Senhaji Mouhri', 'Bianca Salvo', 'Nicolle Bonar', 'Paul Spin', 'Simran Shokar']",BMJ open,2025,10.1136/bmjopen-2025-100889,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40976668/,"In current clinical practice, breast cancer is treated according to hormone receptor and human epidermal growth receptor 2 expression (HER2) status, which play an important role in disease management and overall prognosis. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has been studied in multiple global prospective DESTINY-breast trials. Recent marketing authorisation for T-DXd has been granted from Health Canada for HER2-positive breast cancer who have received prior treatment with trastuzumab emtansine, or at least one prior anti-HER2-based regimen in the metastatic setting, or who have received a prior anti-HER2-based regimen in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. T-DXd is also indicated for HER2-low unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients who have received at least one prior line of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy. However, there is a paucity of evidence assessing T-DXd in the real-world setting. As such, the overarching aim of this study is to generate Canadian real-world evidence on discontinuations and treatment modifications for patients with HER2+ and HER2-low mBC undergoing treatment with T-DXd. This is a hybrid, longitudinal cohort study design leveraging patient support programme (PSP) secondary data with additional primary data collection to assess study treatment-related outcomes among patients with HER2+ and HER2-low mBC receiving treatment with T-DXd. Mainly, this study will leverage secondary data from the PSP, which will include clinical and demographic characteristics as well as duration, modification and intensity of treatment information for patients while enrolled in the PSP. These data will be supplemented with primary data, which will be collected via a patient questionnaire and include additional self-reported clinical and demographic characteristics not captured within the PSP, including follow-up data on therapies received, treatment discontinuation information after the PSP closure and frequency of CT scans and cardiac monitoring scans. The study protocol was approved by the Advarra Institutional Review Board on 13 December 2023 (ID: D133HR00037). Findings will be disseminated by publication in peer-reviewed journals, through oral and poster presentations for various audiences, websites and scientific meetings. Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients prior to agreeing to participate in this study. Participant recruitment for primary data collection began on 22 April 2024 and was completed on 8 October 2024. Primary data collection for follow-up will continue through up to 12 months after the date of the last enrolment. NCT06386263."
40973900,Hormone Receptor Expression and QT interval at Baseline Correlate with Trastuzumab Associated Cardiotoxicity in HER2- Positive Breast Cancer Patients: A Prospective Study.,"['Dana Abo Samra', 'Ibrahem Hanafi', 'Dani Abo Samra', 'Ahmad Naeem', 'Assef Dayyoub']",Cardiovascular toxicology,2025,10.1007/s12012-025-10059-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40973900/,"Trastuzumab is a common and effective therapeutic choice for breast cancer treatment. However, the cardiotoxicity induced by this therapy remains a significant challenge, because we lack predictors that help avoid allocating some patients with high risk to this management plan. This study was aimed to evaluate several baseline risk factors such as prolonged QTc interval, age, and lower expression level of estrogen and progesterone receptors that might predict cardiac toxicity after Trastuzumab therapy. This prospective observational study was conducted in Al-Bairouni Hospital at Damascus University. Patients were evaluated with echocardiography and electrocardiography before therapy and three weeks after the last administration of the fourth cycle. A significant Trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity was determined by a 5% or more reduction in the left ventricular ejection fraction after excluding all other potential causes. A total number of 140 patients with breast cancer, who were indicated Trastuzumab therapy, were recruited for this study. Thirty of them (21.4%) developed Trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity but all were asymptomatic. Corrected QT interval of more than 450 ms and lower expression level of estrogen and progesterone receptors at baseline were associated with higher susceptibility to develop Trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity (P = 0.045, P = 0.004, and P = 0.042, respectively). Of note, preexisting cardiac morbidities, age, and chemotherapy accompanying Trastuzumab administration did not reach significant association with cardiotoxicity. Breast cancer patients with prolonged corrected QT interval or lower expression levels of hormone receptors are at a higher risk of developing Trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity, necessitating careful administration of the therapy."

In this study, we developed a bifunctional octadentate 1,2-HOPO chelator with a methyl tetrazine (Me-Tz) moiety, HOPO-O 8 -Me-Tz, and evaluated its coordination to [ 89 Zr]Zr 4+ , [ 161 Tb]Tb 3+ , and [ 227 Th]Th 4+ for theranostic applications. HOPO-O 8 -Me-Tz was conjugated to HER2/neu targeting antibody Trastuzumab (Tmab), modified with transcyclooctene (TCO), using the inverse electron demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) click reaction to yield HOPO-O 8 -Tmab. Radiolabeled conjugates were synthesized under mild conditions (30 min, ambient temperature) and evaluated in vitro and in vivo in SKOV-3 tumour-bearing nude mice. All radiometal complexes demonstrated high stability in serum over 7 days. In vivo, [ 89 Zr]Zr-, [ 161 Tb]Tb- and [ 227 Th]Th-HOPO-O 8 -Tmab showed high tumour uptake (9.87 ± 3.57, 11.29 ± 4.14 and 19.40 ± 5.40 %ID/g, respectively). Notably, [ 161 Tb]Tb- and [ 227 Th]Th-conjugates exhibited low bone uptake at 96 h post-injection, indicating excellent in vivo stability. The potential redistribution of the alpha-emitting daughter nuclide [ 223 Ra]Ra 2+ from [ 227 Th]Th-HOPO-O 8 -Tmab was assessed, revealing elevated 223 Ra in the bone and joint. These findings underscore the promise of HOPO-O 8 -Me-Tz as a versatile bifunctional chelator for next-generation theranostic radioimmunoconjugates, while also highlighting the importance of managing daughter radionuclide redistribution in alpha therapy."
