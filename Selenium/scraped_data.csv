36344672,PubMed,Targeting HER2-positive breast cancer: advances and future directions.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36344672/,"Swain SM, Shastry M, Hamilton E",Nature reviews. Drug discovery. 2023 Feb.,2023,"The long-sought discovery of HER2 as an actionable and highly sensitive therapeutic target was a major breakthrough for the treatment of highly aggressive HER2-positive breast cancer, leading to approval of the first HER2-targeted drug - the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab - almost 25 years ago. Since then, progress has been swift and the impressive clinical activity across multiple trials with monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates that target HER2 has spawned extensive efforts to develop newer platforms and more targeted therapies. This Review discusses the current standards of care for HER2-positive breast cancer, mechanisms of resistance to HER2-targeted therapy and new therapeutic approaches and agents, including strategies to harness the immune system."
36162822,PubMed,Dexrazoxane for preventing or reducing cardiotoxicity in adults and children with cancer receiving anthracyclines.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36162822/,"de Baat EC, Mulder RL, Armenian S, Feijen EA, Grotenhuis H, Hudson MM, Mavinkurve-Groothuis AM, Kremer LC, van Dalen EC",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews. 2022 Sep 27.,2022,"This review is the third update of a previously published Cochrane Review. The original review, looking at all possible cardioprotective agents, was split and this part now focuses on dexrazoxane only. Anthracyclines are effective chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of numerous malignancies. Unfortunately, their use is limited by a dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. In an effort to prevent or reduce this cardiotoxicity, different cardioprotective agents have been studied, including dexrazoxane. To assess the efficacy of dexrazoxane to prevent or reduce cardiotoxicity and determine possible effects of dexrazoxane on antitumour efficacy, quality of life and toxicities other than cardiac damage in adults and children with cancer receiving anthracyclines when compared to placebo or no additional treatment. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to May 2021. We also handsearched reference lists, the proceedings of relevant conferences and ongoing trials registers. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which dexrazoxane was compared to no additional therapy or placebo in adults and children with cancer receiving anthracyclines. Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, risk of bias and GRADE assessment of included studies. We analysed results in adults and children separately. We performed analyses according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For this update, we identified 548 unique records. We included three additional RCTs: two paediatric and one adult. Therefore, we included a total of 13 eligible RCTs (five paediatric and eight adult). The studies enrolled 1252 children with leukaemia, lymphoma or a solid tumour and 1269 participants, who were mostly diagnosed with breast cancer. In adults, moderate-quality evidence showed that there was less clinical heart failure with the use of dexrazoxane (risk ratio (RR) 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.43; 7 studies, 1221 adults). In children, we identified no difference in clinical heart failure risk between treatment groups (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.19; 3 studies, 885 children; low-quality evidence). In three paediatric studies assessing cardiomyopathy/heart failure as the primary cause of death, none of the children had this outcome (1008 children, low-quality evidence). In the adult studies, different definitions for subclinical myocardial dysfunction and clinical heart failure combined were used, but pooled analyses were possible: there was a benefit in favour of the use of dexrazoxane (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.56; 3 studies, 417 adults and RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.66; 2 studies, 534 adults, respectively, moderate-quality evidence). In the paediatric studies, definitions of subclinical myocardial dysfunction and clinical heart failure combined were incomparable, making pooling impossible. One paediatric study showed a benefit in favour of dexrazoxane (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.85; 33 children; low-quality evidence), whereas another study showed no difference between treatment groups (Fischer exact P = 0.12; 537 children; very low-quality evidence). Overall survival (OS) was reported in adults and overall mortality in children. The meta-analyses of both outcomes showed no difference between treatment groups (hazard ratio (HR) 1.04, 95% 0.88 to 1.23; 4 studies; moderate-quality evidence; and HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.42; 3 studies, 1008 children; low-quality evidence, respectively). Progression-free survival (PFS) was only reported in adults. We subdivided PFS into three analyses based on the comparability of definitions, and identified a longer PFS in favour of dexrazoxane in one study (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.90; 164 adults; low-quality evidence). There was no difference between treatment groups in the other two analyses (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.40; 1 study; low-quality evidence; and HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.43; 2 studies; moderate-quality evidence, respectively). In adults, there was no difference in tumour response rate between treatment groups (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.04; 6 studies, 956 adults; moderate-quality evidence). We subdivided tumour response rate in children into two analyses based on the comparability of definitions, and identified no difference between treatment groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.07; 1 study, 206 children; very low-quality evidence; and RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01; 1 study, 200 children; low-quality evidence, respectively). The occurrence of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN) was only assessed in children. The available and worst-case analyses were identical and showed a difference in favour of the control group (RR 3.08, 95% CI 1.13 to 8.38; 3 studies, 1015 children; low-quality evidence). In the best-case analysis, the direction of effect was the same, but there was no difference between treatment groups (RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.96 to 6.53; 4 studies, 1220 children; low-quality evidence). For other adverse effects, results also varied. None of the studies evaluated quality of life. If not reported, the number of participants for an analysis was unclear. Our meta-analyses showed the efficacy of dexrazoxane in preventing or reducing cardiotoxicity in adults treated with anthracyclines. In children, there was a difference between treatment groups for one cardiac outcome (i.e. for one of the definitions used for clinical heart failure and subclinical myocardial dysfunction combined) in favour of dexrazoxane. In adults, no evidence of a negative effect on tumour response rate, OS and PFS was identified; and in children, no evidence of a negative effect on tumour response rate and overall mortality was identified. The results for adverse effects varied. In children, dexrazoxane may be associated with a higher risk of SMN; in adults this was not addressed. In adults, the quality of the evidence ranged between moderate and low; in children, it ranged between low and very low. Before definitive conclusions on the use of dexrazoxane can be made, especially in children, more high-quality research is needed. We conclude that if the risk of cardiac damage is expected to be high, it might be justified to use dexrazoxane in children and adults with cancer who are treated with anthracyclines. However, clinicians and patients should weigh the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane against the possible risk of adverse effects, including SMN, for each individual. For children, the International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group has developed a clinical practice guideline."

However, the inevitable occurrence of acquired trastuzumab resistance limits the drug benefit, and there is currently no effective reversal measure. Existing researches on the mechanism of trastuzumab resistance mainly focused on tumor cells themselves, while the understanding of the mechanisms of environment-mediated drug resistance is relatively lacking. This study aimed to further explore the mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance to identify strategies to promote survival in these patients. Trastuzumab-sensitive and trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive tumor tissues and cells were collected for transcriptome sequencing. Bioinformatics were used to analyze cell subtypes, metabolic pathways, and molecular signaling pathways. Changes in microenvironmental indicators (such as macrophage, angiogenesis, and metabolism) were verified by immunofluorescence (IF) and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses. Finally, a multi-scale agent-based model (ABM) was constructed. The effects of combination treatment were further validated in nude mice to verify these effects predicted by the ABM. Based on transcriptome sequencing, molecular biology, and in vivo experiments, we found that the level of glutamine metabolism in trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive cells was increased, and glutaminase 1 (GLS1) was significantly overexpressed. Meanwhile, tumor-derived GLS1 microvesicles drove M2 macrophage polarization. Furthermore, angiogenesis promoted trastuzumab resistance. IHC showed high glutamine metabolism, M2 macrophage polarization, and angiogenesis in trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive tumor tissues from patients and nude mice. Mechanistically, the cell division cycle 42 (CDC42) promoted GLS1 expression in tumor cells by activating nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) p65 and drove GLS1 microvesicle secretion through IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1). Based on the ABM and in vivo experiments, we confirmed that the combination of anti-glutamine metabolism, anti-angiogenesis, and pro-M1 polarization therapy had the best effect in reversing trastuzumab resistance in HER2-positive gastric cancer. This study revealed that tumor cells secrete GLS1 microvesicles via CDC42 to promote glutamine metabolism, M2 macrophage polarization, and pro-angiogenic function of macrophages, leading to acquired trastuzumab resistance in HER2-positive gastric cancer. A combination of anti-glutamine metabolism, anti-angiogenesis, and pro-M1 polarization therapy may provide a new insight into reversing trastuzumab resistance."

However, anti-HER2 therapies are only currently approved for the treatment of breast and gastric/gastric esophageal junction cancers and treatment resistance remains a problem. Here, we engineer an anti-HER2 IgG1 bispecific, biparatopic antibody (Ab), zanidatamab, with unique and enhanced functionalities compared to both trastuzumab and the combination of trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (tras + pert). Zanidatamab binds adjacent HER2 molecules in trans and initiates distinct HER2 reorganization, as shown by polarized cell surface HER2 caps and large HER2 clusters, not observed with trastuzumab or tras + pert. Moreover, zanidatamab, but not trastuzumab nor tras + pert, elicit potent complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against high HER2-expressing tumor cells in vitro. Zanidatamab also mediates HER2 internalization and downregulation, inhibition of both cell signaling and tumor growth, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADCP), and also shows superior in vivo antitumor activity compared to tras + pert in a HER2-expressing xenograft model. Collectively, we show that zanidatamab has multiple and distinct mechanisms of action derived from the structural effects of biparatopic HER2 engagement."

We report the results of comparing observation with two durations of trastuzumab treatment at a median follow-up of 11 years, for patients enrolled in the HERA (HERceptin Adjuvant) trial. HERA (BIG 1-01) is an international, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 randomised trial of 5102 women with HER2-positive early breast cancer, who were enrolled from hospitals in 39 countries between Dec 7, 2001, and June 20, 2005. After completion of all primary therapy (including, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy as indicated), patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive trastuzumab for 1 year (once at 8 mg/kg of bodyweight intravenously, then 6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks) or for 2 years (with the same dose schedule), or to the observation group. Primary endpoint is disease-free survival, and analyses are in the intention-to-treat population. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from Cox models, and survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab is based on 366-day landmark analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00045032). Of the 5102 women randomly assigned in the HERA trial, three patients had no evidence of having provided written informed consent to participate. We followed up the intention-to-treat population of 5099 patients (1697 in observation, 1702 in 1-year trastuzumab, and 1700 in 2-years trastuzumab groups). After a median follow-up of 11 years (IQR 10·09-11·53), random assignment to 1 year of trastuzumab significantly reduced the risk of a disease-free survival event (HR 0·76, 95% CI 0·68-0·86) and death (0·74, 0·64-0·86) compared with observation. 2 years of adjuvant trastuzumab did not improve disease free-survival outcomes compared with 1 year of this drug (HR 1·02, 95% CI 0·89-1·17). Estimates of 10-year disease-free survival were 63% for observation, 69% for 1 year of trastuzumab, and 69% for 2 years of trastuzumab. 884 (52%) patients assigned to the observation group selectively crossed over to receive trastuzumab. Cardiac toxicity remained low in all groups and occurred mostly during the treatment phase. The incidence of secondary cardiac endpoints was 122 (7·3%) in the 2-years trastuzumab group, 74 (4·4%) in the 1-year trastuzumab group, and 15 (0·9%) in the observation group. 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab after chemotherapy for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer significantly improves long-term disease-free survival, compared with observation. 2 years of trastuzumab had no additional benefit.

Global longitudinal strain (GLS) is a robust and sensitive marker of LV dysfunction, but existing observational data have been insufficient to support a routine GLS-guided strategy for CPT. This study sought to identify whether GLS-guided CPT prevents reduction in LVEF and development of CTRCD in high-risk patients undergoing potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy, compared with usual care. In this international, multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial, 331 anthracycline-treated patients with another heart failure risk factor were randomly allocated to CPT initiation guided by either ≥12% relative reduction in GLS (n = 166) or >10% absolute reduction of LVEF (n = 165). Patients were followed for EF and development of CTRCD (symptomatic EF reduction of >5% or >10% asymptomatic to <55%) over 1 year. Of 331 randomized patients, 2 died, and 22 withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up. Among 307 patients (age: 54 ± 12 years; 94% women; baseline LVEF: 59 ± 6%; GLS: -20.6 ± 2.4%) with a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 1.02 years (0.98 to 1.07 years), most (n = 278) had breast cancer. Heart failure risk factors were prevalent: 29% had hypertension, and 13% had diabetes mellitus. At the 1-year follow-up, although the primary outcome of change in LVEF was not significantly different between the 2 arms, there was significantly greater use of CPT, and fewer patients met CTRCD criteria in the GLS-guided than the EF-guided arm (5.8% vs. 13.7%; p = 0.02), and the 1-year EF was 57 ± 6% versus 55 ± 7% (p = 0.05). Patients who received CPT in the EF-guided arm had a larger reduction in LVEF at follow-up than in the GLS-guided arm (9.1 ± 10.9% vs. 2.9 ± 7.4%; p = 0.03). Although the change in LVEF was not different between the 2 arms as a whole, when patients who received CPT were compared, those in the GLS-guided arm had a significantly lower reduction in LVEF at 1 year follow-up. Furthermore, GLS-guided CPT significantly reduced a meaningful fall of LVEF to the abnormal range. The results support the use of GLS in surveillance for CTRCD.

We found that trastuzumab-resistant (TR) gastric cancer cells exhibited high glycolytic activity, which was controlled by hexokinase 2 (HK2)-dependent glycolysis with a circadian pattern [higher at zeitgeber time (ZT) 6, lower at ZT18]. Mechanistically, HK2 circadian oscillation was regulated by a transcriptional complex composed of PPARγ and the core clock gene PER1. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that silencing PER1 disrupted the circadian rhythm of PER1-HK2 and reversed trastuzumab resistance. Moreover, metformin, which inhibits glycolysis and PER1, combined with trastuzumab at ZT6, significantly improved trastuzumab efficacy in gastric cancer. Collectively, these data introduce the circadian clock into trastuzumab therapy and propose a potentially effective chronotherapy strategy to reverse trastuzumab resistance in gastric cancer. In trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive gastric cancer, glycolysis fluctuates with a circadian oscillation regulated by the BMAL1-CLOCK-PER1-HK2 axis, which can be disrupted with a metformin-based chronotherapy to overcome trastuzumab resistance."

In low-risk nonrandomized patients with cardiac troponin I concentrations in the lower 2 tertiles, we hypothesized the absence of a 6-month change in left ventricular ejection fraction and tested for equivalence of ±2%. Between October 2017 and June 2021, 175 patients (mean age, 53 years; 87% female; 71% with breast cancer) were recruited. Patients randomized to cardioprotection (n=29) or standard care (n=28) had left ventricular ejection fractions of 69.4±7.4% and 69.1±6.1% at baseline and 65.7±6.6% and 64.9±5.9% 6 months after completion of chemotherapy, respectively. After adjustment for age, pretreatment left ventricular ejection fraction, and planned anthracycline dose, the estimated mean difference in 6-month left ventricular ejection fraction between the cardioprotection and standard care groups was -0.37% (95% CI, -3.59% to 2.85%;  Combination candesartan and carvedilol therapy had no demonstrable cardioprotective effect in patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy with high-risk on-treatment cardiac troponin I concentrations. Low-risk nonrandomized patients had similar declines in left ventricular ejection fraction, bringing into question the utility of routine cardiac troponin monitoring. Furthermore, the modest declines in left ventricular ejection fraction suggest that the value and clinical impact of early cardioprotection therapy need to be better defined in patients receiving high-dose anthracycline.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and potential resistance of second ADC (ADC2) following the first ADC (ADC1) in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and HER2-low MBC. This retrospective, multicenter, real-world study enrolled patients with MBC who received at least 2 different types of ADCs in 3 hospitals in China between July 1, 2017 and May 1, 2023. Outcomes included the objective response rate (ORR) for ADC1 and ADC2, progression free survival 2 (PFS2), defined as the time from initiation of ADC2 to progression, and overall survival (OS). Seventy-nine female patients were included, 64 of whom had HER2-positive disease. The ORR for ADC2 with similar payload of ADC1 was found to be 5.3%. When switching to a different payload, the ORR of ADC2 increased to 22.6%. The PFS2 for ADC2 remained similar regardless of whether the payload was similar or different. Switching to different payload showed a higher ORR in patients with rapid progression and a durable response longer than 6 months (41.2% vs 15.0%). Specifically, significantly longer PFS2 and OS were seen in patients treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-Dxd) compared to those treated with disitamab vedotin (RC48) after progression from trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1; median PFS2 5.37 months vs 3.30 months, HR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.17-0.93, P = .034; median OS 50.6 months vs 20.2 months, HR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.08-0.91, P = .034). For patients who progressed after T-Dxd, the median PFS2 was 6.05 months for those treated with RC48 versus 0.93 months for those treated with T-DM1 (HR = 0.03, 95% CI 0.002-0.353, P = .0093). Genomic analysis revealed that alternation of retinoblastoma1 was significantly associated with superior PFS. The alternation of payload achieves different responses in different settings. T-Dxd followed by RC48 may be a potentially beneficial strategy in HER2-positive disease. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of cross-resistance."

We performed a double-blind randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of crocin (crocin tablets) in reducing anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either treatment with crocin tablets or placebo for 6 months. Primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients with a drop in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of at least 10 % from baseline until 6 months. We randomized 200 patients; 7 of them had no valid randomization as the change in chemotherapy scheme. A total of 193 eligible participants (mean [SD] age, 50.9 [9.6] years; all women) were randomly assigned to receive crocin tablets or placebo. The incidence of the primary efficacy outcome was 7.2 % (7/97) in the crocin group and 17.7 % (17/96) in the placebo group (P = 0.027). At 6 months, there were significant differences in the mean change of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) between the groups (3.06 [-25.18-6.95] vs. 3.06 [-4.85-24.98] pg/ml; P = 0.017).

DESTINY-Breast04 demonstrated that trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-Dxd) had a survival advantage comparing to the physician's choice of chemotherapy for patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer. But at the same time, this expensive novel treatment also brought an economic burden. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of T-Dxd based on results of DESTINY-Breast04 from the perspective of Chinese healthcare system. A three-state partitioned-survival model [progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD) and death] based on data from DESTINY-Breast04 and Chinese healthcare system was used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of T-Dxd vs. the physician's choice of chemotherapy for HER2-low metastatic breast cancer. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the ICER in terms of 2022 US$ per QALY gained were calculated for both hormone receptor-positive cohort and all patients. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the model robustness. Compared with the physician's choice of chemotherapy, T-Dxd increased costs by $104,168.30, while gaining 0.31 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $336,026.77 per QALY in all patients. The costs of T-Dxd and the utility of PFS were the crucial factors in determining the ICER. In the hormone receptor-positive cohort, the ICER was lower than that in all patients, with the ICER of $274,905.72 per QALY. The ICER was much higher than the commonly accepted willingness-to-pay threshold ($357,96.83 per QALY).

Whether such cardioprotective effects can be seen in trastuzumab-treated patients has not been explored. Consecutive women with HER2+ breast cancer who received trastuzumab with or without anthracyclines were identified retrospectively. Patients receiving statins before and during cancer treatment were matched with 2 patients of the same age (± 2 years) and anthracycline exposure status but without statin treatment. The primary outcome was final left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to assess the relationship between statin exposure and the final LVEF. A logistic regression model was constructed to assess the relationship between statin exposure and cardiotoxicity (secondary outcome). Included were 129 patients (62 ± 9 years). Forty-three received statins during cancer treatment. The median trastuzumab exposure time was 11.8 (interquartile range [IQR] 11 to 12) months. Seventy-two (56%) patients received anthracyclines. Compared with controls, patients treated with statins were more likely to have diabetes (37.2% vs 4.7%, P < 0.001), hypertension (58.1% vs 22.1%, P < 0.001), and coronary artery disease (11.6% vs 2.3%, P = 0.04).

Due to the distinctive pharmacokinetics, indications, and administration methods of trastuzumab, this understanding becomes crucial. Drug exposure can be assessed by measuring trastuzumab's peak concentration, trough concentration, or area under the curve through assays like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The dose-response (D-R) and exposure-response (E-R) relationships establish the correlation between drug dosage/exposure and the therapeutic effect and safety. Additionally, various covariates such as body weight, aspartate transaminase, and albumin levels can influence drug exposure. This review provides a comprehensive overview of trastuzumab's mechanism of action, data on steady-state concentration and PK parameters under multiple administration routes and indications, discussions on factors influencing PK parameters, and evaluations of the effectiveness and safety of E-R and D-R in diverse HER2-positive cancer patients."

In addition, we develop a fully humanized immunocompetent model of HER2+ breast cancer recapitulating ex vivo the biological processes that associate with patients' response to treatment. Thanks to these two approaches, we uncover a population of TGF-beta-activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) specific from tumors resistant to therapy. The presence of this cellular subset related to previously described myofibroblastic (CAF-S1) and podoplanin+ CAF subtypes in breast cancer associates with low IL2 activity.

The duration of trastuzumab treatments ranged from 3 to 60 months. Declines in LVEF ≥ 15% were seen mainly after 3-15 months of trastuzumab treatment, and LVEF was lowest at 15 months, which coincided with the largest decline in LVEF from baseline. Spearman correlation coefficients indicated that accumulation of anthracycline, the use of cyto/cardioprotective drugs (CPD) and the duration of trastuzumab treatment were all associated with the change of LVEF, and there was a strong correlation between these factors and the change of LVEF (ρ=0.81, ρ=0.734 and ρ=0.777 respectively). These results indicate that significant decreases of LVEF may be seen after 3-15 months of trastuzumab treatment, but that there is a favorable benefit-risk ratio for patients undergoing long-term trastuzumab treatment."

        <p>Background
 Breast cancer, particularly the Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive subtype, poses a significant health challenge for women worldwide. Trastuzumab plus Pertuzumab therapy has shown efficacy in treating HER2-positive breast cancer, but its use is limited by associated cardiotoxicity. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) suggests that Platycodon grandiflorus A. DC. (PG) may have cardioprotective effects due to its ability to nourish qi and blood. This study aims to investigate the effective and safety of PG in preventing cardiotoxicity associated with anti-HER2 therapy.
Method
 In this double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, approximately 120 patients will be randomly assigned to either the PG or placebo groups, alongside undergoing 12 months of dual anti-HER2 therapies in a 1:1 ratio. Cardiotoxicity will be assessed at a median follow-up of 1 year. The primary outcome measure is left ventricular global longitudinal strain, with secondary outcomes including: (1) changes in left ventricular ejection fraction, (2) the occurrence of cardiotoxicity, (3) the occurrence of trastuzumab plus pertuzumab interruption, and (4) event free survival and overall survival rates among patients.
Discussion
 This will be the first clinical study to determine whether PG can reduce the cardiotoxicity induced by trastuzumab plus pertuzumab treatment in HER2-positive early breast cancer patients.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the changes in epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) before and after treatment in BC patients who received anthracyclines adjuvant chemotherapy protocol (AC-T) and anthracyclines combined with trastuzumabadjuvant chemotherapy protocol (AC-TH). Additionally, we assessed whether there were any differences in the changes in EAT between the two groups of patients. Our objective was to examine the effects of anthracyclines and trastuzumab on EAT and determine the potential role of EAT changes on CTX. Methods: We reviewed female BC patients who were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy protocols of AC-T and AC-TH, all of whom underwent baseline (T0) and follow-up (T1) chest computed tomography (CT) and echocardiography. A cohort of healthy women, matched in age, underwent two chest CTs. EAT was quantified on chest CT using semi-automated software. CTX was defined as a &gt;10% reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from baseline, with an absolute value of &lt;53%. Results: A total of 41 BC patients were included in the study, with 23 patients in the AC-T group and 18 patients in the AC-TH group. Additionally, 22 healthy females were included as the normal group. None of the BC patients developed CTX after chemotherapy. The age did not differ significantly between the normal group and the AC-T group (p = 0.341) or the AC-TH group (p = 0.853). Similarly, the body mass index (BMI) of the normal group was comparable to that of the AC-T group (p = 0.377, 0.346) and the AC-TH group (p = 0.148, 0.119) before and after chemotherapy. The EAT volume index (mL/kg/m2) was significantly higher in both the AC-T group (5.11 ± 1.85 vs. 4.34 ± 1.55, p &lt; 0.001) and the AC-TH group (4.53 ± 1.61 vs. 3.48 ± 1.62, p &lt; 0.001) at T1 compared with T0. In addition, both the AC-T group (–72.95 ± 5.01 vs. –71.22 ± 3.91, p = 0.005) and the AC-TH group (–72.55 ± 5.27 vs. –68.20 ± 5.98, p &lt; 0.001) exhibited a significant decrease in EAT radiodensity (HU) at T1 compared to T0. However, there was no significant difference observed in the normal group. At T0, no difference was seen in EAT volume index (4.34 ± 1.55 vs. 3.48 ± 1.62, p = 0.090) and radiodensity (–71.22 ± 3.91 vs. –68.20 ± 5.98, p = 0.059) between the AC-T and AC-TH groups. Similarly, at T1, there was still no significant difference observed in the EAT volume index (–5.11 ± 1.85 vs. 4.53 ± 1.61, p = 0.308) and radiodensity (–72.95 ± 5.00 vs. –72.54 ± 5.27, p = 0.802) between the two groups. Conclusions: BC patients who underwent AC-T and AC-TH adjuvant chemotherapy protocols demonstrated a significant rise in the volume index of EAT, along with a substantial reduction in its radiodensity post-chemotherapy. These findings indicate that alterations in EAT could potentially aid in identifying cardiac complications caused by chemotherapeutic agents and remind clinicians to focus on changes in EAT after adjuvant chemotherapy in BC patients to prevent the practical occurrence of CTX."

Nevertheless, heart failure (HF) has become a significant side effect of these regimens. This study aimed to investigate the incidence and factors associated with HF in breast cancer patients treated with anthracyclines with or without trastuzumab. A retrospective cohort study was performed in patients with breast cancer who were treated with anthracyclines with or without trastuzumab between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2018. The primary outcome was the incidence of HF. The secondary outcome was the risk factors associated with HF by using the univariable and multivariable cox-proportional hazard model. A total of 475 breast cancer patients were enrolled with a median follow-up time of 2.88 years (interquartile range (IQR), 1.59–3.93). The incidence of HF was 3.2%, corresponding to an incidence rate of 11.1 per 1000 person-years. The increased risk of HF was seen in patients receiving a combination of anthracycline and trastuzumab therapy, patients treated with radiotherapy or palliative-intent chemotherapy, and baseline left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;65%, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in other risk factors for HF, such as age, cardiovascular comorbidities, and cumulative doxorubicin dose. In conclusion, the incidence of HF was consistently high in patients receiving combination anthracyclines trastuzumab regimens. A reduced baseline left ventricular ejection fraction, radiotherapy, and palliative-intent chemotherapy were associated with an increased risk of HF. Intensive cardiac monitoring in breast cancer patients with an increased risk of HF should be advised to prevent undesired cardiac outcomes."

groups: Patients (n = 56) assigned to the ketotifen group received
ketotifen 1 mg three times daily for six consecutive cycles of

Dang, Kevin C. Oeffinger, Richard Steingart, Adam Schmitt",Journal of Clinical Oncology,2022,"12090  Background: There is currently no way to reliably predict which patients undergoing therapy for breast cancer will develop cardiotoxicity. An early biomarker of cardiotoxicity could provide opportunity for intervention prior to the appearance of gross abnormalities on echocardiogram (ECHO). A droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay for circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) can detect cfDNA released from dying cardiomyocytes with high sensitivity by differentiating cfDNA of cardiomyocyte origin based on the pattern of methylation specific to the cell type. Circulating cfDNA of cardiac origin was tested as an early biomarker of toxicity in patients who underwent breast cancer treatment while closely monitoring cardiac function in a prospective clinical trial. Methods: A cardiomyocyte methylation-specific quantitative ddPCR assay was tested in plasma samples from 29 patients who were part of a larger prospectively enrolled cohort of women who received anthracyclines and trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer. Blood samples were tested from prior to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) chemotherapy, two months later after completing AC and prior to trastuzumab, and every 3 months to 12 months post-treatment. Patients were assessed for clinical cardiotoxicity, defined as heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) or significant EF decline (&gt; = 10% to below 53% or &gt; = 16%) until completion of cancer therapy. The maximum detected level of cardiac cfDNA (copies per 500 µL plasma) was compared between those who experienced cardiotoxicity and those who did not by two-sided T-tests. Results are reported as mean +/- standard deviation. Results: At baseline, cardiac cfDNA levels were low (mean 1.1 +/- 2.4 copies). Of 29 patients, five developed clinical cardiotoxicity. The maximum number of cfDNA copies at any time point was elevated in patients who experienced cardiotoxicity compared to those who did not (mean of 20.6 +/- 7.3 copies versus 9.3 +/- 9.8 copies, p = 0.0216). Of the patients with cardiotoxicity, elevated cfDNA of greater than 10 copies was detected an average of 3.6 +/- 2.5 months prior to the onset of clinical cardiotoxicity. Conclusions: Methylation specific cardiac cfDNA shows promise as an early indicator of cardiotoxicity in patients treated with anthracyclines in this pilot study. A previously reported analysis in the levels of seven other biomarkers including high-sensitivity troponin I and NT-proBNP pre- versus post-treatment in the full cohort of 80 patients did not show any statistically significant associations with the development of cardiotoxicity, suggesting that cardiac cfDNA may be uniquely informative.

Dexrazoxane is the only cardioprotectant that has proven efficacy in reducing cardiotoxic effects when given prior to the administration of anthracyclines. Currently, it is still considered an “off-label” use due to a paucity of data in the literature on dexrazoxane administration in children. Nevertheless, through evaluation of the available data, dexrazoxane is observed to be safe, tolerable, and efficacious in mitigating the cardiotoxic effects of anthracycline in children, without jeopardizing its antineoplastic activity or increasing the risk of developing secondary malignant neoplasms."
